I told AI to research everything about me on the internet and generate me a readme. This is what it came up with -

### 🧘‍♂️ The Philosophy

I am a digital craftsman and a relentless builder. For me, code is not just about utility—it is a medium for exploring cognitive, sociological, and physical concepts.

My journey hasn't been about collecting languages or frameworks, but about **evolving my understanding of systems**. I view life and engineering as an "optimization game," where every line of code and every decision is a move toward clarity, efficiency, and sovereignty.

I write about these mental models and my experiments in thinking on my blog, **[NeuralCalculus](https://neuralcalculus.com)**.

### 🛠 What I Build

I don't restrict myself to a single domain. Instead, I tend to build projects that fall into specific "archetypes" of engineering:

* **🛡️ Sovereign Systems:** I build "local-first" tools that prioritize privacy and user ownership. I believe in software that respects the user, keeping data on the device and away from the cloud whenever possible.
* **🎨 Computational Creativity:** I explore the intersection of algorithms and art. From audio signal processing to generative visuals, I create engines that help computers "understand" and replicate human creativity.
* **🧠 Cognitive Architectures:** I am deeply interested in how we can model memory and intelligence. My work often involves simulating biological patterns—like spatial memory or neural topology—within digital environments.
* **⚡ High-Performance Engines:** Whether it's fault-tolerant distributed systems or lightning-fast CLIs, I obsess over performance, concurrency, and architectural purity.

### ⏳ The Timeline

I made myself a cool timeline that people loved. So I made a SaaS for everyone to make cool timelines for free - githubtimeline.com\
Here is my timeline -
